# Multi Robot Production Pipeline [Dual UR5, TurtleBot3] Using ROS
Multi-robot production-line in Gazebo, featuring two UR5 arms and a TurtleBot3 mobile robot, to autonomously pick up a box from a conveyor, transport it between stations, and place it into a final bin.

# Hello (Real) World with ROS
A hands‑on robotics project showcasing key Robot Operating System (ROS) concepts through six progressive modules.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive robotics project built with ROS, demonstrating how to model, simulate, and control robots in virtual environments. Over six stages, it walks through:

1. **Environment Modeling & Robot Description**
2. **Autonomous Navigation**
3. **Robot Manipulation**
4. **Computer Vision Integration**
5. **Factory Automation**

Each stage is organized into its own folder, complete with code, launch files, and documentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and simulate robot models using URDF
- Build and configure virtual worlds in Gazebo
- Implement autonomous navigation with the ROS navigation stack
- Develop manipulation routines for robotic arms
- Integrate vision pipelines for detection and tracking
- Orchestrate multi‐robot factory processes
