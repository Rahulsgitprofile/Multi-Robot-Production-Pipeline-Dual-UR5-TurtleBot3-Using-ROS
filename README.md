# Multi Robot Production Pipeline [Dual UR5, TurtleBot3] Using ROS
Multi-robot production-line in Gazebo, featuring two UR5 arms and a TurtleBot3 mobile robot, to autonomously pick up a box from a conveyor, transport it between stations, and place it into a final bin.

### 🗺️ TurtleBot3 SLAM Mapping

TurtleBot3 explores and maps an unknown environment using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The 2D occupancy grid below was generated using LIDAR data in a simulated Gazebo world.

### 🤖 Robot Arm Manipulation with MoveIt

Using the MoveIt framework, a robotic arm (UR5) plans and executes precise pick-and-place motions. Below is a video showing trajectory planning and object manipulation in a simulated environment.

### 🧭 Autonomous Navigation with TurtleBot3

The TurtleBot3 robot autonomously navigates between waypoints using the ROS Navigation Stack. The system handles localization, path planning, and real-time obstacle avoidance.

### 🏭 Multi-Robot Factory Automation

The final capstone simulation presents a smart production line in Gazebo:  
- **Two UR5 arms** pick and place packages  
- A **TurtleBot3 mobile robot** transports them between stations  
- Entire sequence is autonomous, coordinated, and vision-aware

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive robotics project built with ROS, demonstrating how to model, simulate, and control robots in virtual environments. Over six stages, it walks through:

1. **Environment Modeling & Robot Description**
2. **Autonomous Navigation**
3. **Robot Manipulation**
4. **Computer Vision Integration**
5. **Factory Automation**

Each stage is organized into its own folder, complete with code, launch files, and documentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and simulate robot models using URDF
- Build and configure virtual worlds in Gazebo
- Implement autonomous navigation with the ROS navigation stack
- Develop manipulation routines for robotic arms
- Integrate vision pipelines for detection and tracking
- Orchestrate multi‐robot factory processes
