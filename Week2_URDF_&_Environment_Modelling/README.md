# Week 2 ‚Äì Robot Modeling & Environment Setup (URDF + Gazebo)

This stage focuses on building custom robot models and virtual environments to simulate realistic robotic interactions. Using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), the robot‚Äôs physical structure, joints, sensors, and visuals are defined. These models are integrated with Gazebo for testing inside a simulated world. The setup forms the digital twin of the robot for future tasks like navigation, manipulation, and perception.
