# Week1 – Introduction to ROS & Basics

Welcome to **Week 1** of the Comprehensive Robotics Project Suite with ROS! In this stage, you’ll get hands‑on with the fundamentals of ROS (Robot Operating System), learn to set up your development environment, and write your first publisher/subscriber nodes. By the end of this week, you will:

- Understand the ROS architecture: nodes, topics, messages, and master
- Install and configure ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04
- Create a catkin workspace and your first ROS package
- Write simple “talker” (publisher) and “listener” (subscriber) nodes in Python/C++
- Explore the built-in **turtlesim** simulator to visualize message passing
