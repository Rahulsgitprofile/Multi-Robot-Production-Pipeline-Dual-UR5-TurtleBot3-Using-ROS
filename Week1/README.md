# Week 1 – ROS Workspace Setup & Communication Nodes

This stage lays the groundwork for the robotics project by setting up the ROS development environment and implementing basic communication between nodes. It involves creating a workspace, defining custom packages, and building a publisher–subscriber system in both Python and C++. The structure serves as a minimal testbed for validating ROS messaging and tooling.

## 🛠️ Components Developed

- **Catkin Workspace**: Organized folder structure for managing ROS packages
- **Publisher–Subscriber Nodes**: Simple text-based message exchange using `std_msgs/String`
  - Implemented in both Python and C++
- **Turtlesim Interaction**: Used for visual validation of message publishing on `/turtle1/cmd_vel`
- **Launch File**: Single-click launch of the communication pipeline for faster iteration
